Immigration remains a contentious political issue in Australia, particularly for parties like One Nation. However, examining Australian Bureau of Statistics data reveals important demographic trends underlying immigration policy.

Since 2012, Australia's birth rate has declined by approximately 1,525 births annually, while deaths have increased by roughly 3,375 per year. The graph projects a critical inflection point around 2037, when deaths are forecast to exceed births for the first time in modern Australian history. Beyond this crossover, Australia will experience natural population decline—where deaths outpace births—making immigration essential for any population growth. The full force of the "Silver Tsunami" accelerates through the 2040s, when the aging population will place unprecedented strain on healthcare, aged care, and social services while the working-age population shrinks relative to retirees.

The government's target of 239,000 net migrants annually appears designed to offset this demographic shift. The elevated migration figures of 438,000 (2022), 531,000 (2023), and 330,000 (2024) represent a correction following pandemic-era border closures in 2020-2021, when migration nearly ceased. These elevated numbers suggest the government is attempting to build demographic resilience ahead of the projected 2037 crisis point.

Interestingly, birth rates remained stable—even slightly increasing by approximately 15,000 in 2021—during the period of lowest immigration. This suggests that births are driven primarily by existing citizens and permanent residents rather than recent arrivals, raising a critical question: what pronatalist policies might encourage higher birth rates among the established population?

Australia has experimented with such policies before. The government introduced a $3,000 lump sum baby bonus in 2004, which correlated with an immediate increase of 15,000 births in subsequent years. When the bonus rose to $4,000 in 2006, births increased by nearly 19,000 in 2007. A further increase to $5,000 in 2008, however, produced no dramatic rise. Birth rates plateaued with modest increases until peaking in 2012 at approximately 315,000 births—the highest point visible on the graph. In 2014, citing sustainability concerns, the government replaced the $5,000 lump sum with a reduced payment of $2,000-$3,000 distributed over 13 weeks. Since then, birth rates have been in gradual decline, reaching approximately 290,000 by 2024.

The timing is significant: the baby bonus was eliminated precisely when birth rates were at their peak, and the subsequent decade has seen consistent decline. While correlation does not prove causation, the pattern suggests that financial incentives may have played a role in maintaining higher birth rates. However, the diminishing returns from bonus increases (the 2008 increase to $5,000 produced no spike) indicate that cash payments alone cannot overcome deeper structural barriers to having children.

The graph's projections carry substantial uncertainty, particularly beyond 2030, as shown by the widening confidence intervals. However, even the most optimistic scenarios show continued divergence between births and deaths. The evidence suggests that immigration itself has minimal impact on birth rates. Unless the government addresses fundamental cost-of-living and housing affordability issues—the structural factors that likely explain why larger baby bonuses lose effectiveness—declining fertility will persist regardless of migration levels.

Australia faces a stark choice: either reverse the birth rate decline through comprehensive pronatalist policies that address economic barriers to family formation, or accept permanent reliance on immigration to maintain population stability. Current trends suggest the government has chosen the latter path, but the political sustainability of high immigration levels remains questionable. Without addressing the root causes of declining birth rates, Australia appears headed toward the 2037 crossover point and the intensifying Silver Tsunami of the 2040s—regardless of immigration policy.
